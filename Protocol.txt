All numbers are little endian.

* Store list of files and their "ids" (as well as sizes for reference).
* Store physical extents by file:
  - An extent works analogously to a `struct fiemap_extent`. The flags are
    different though.
  - Extent {
      file-id,
      file-offset,
      physical-offset
      length
      flags
    }
  - Every physical extent is written only once.
