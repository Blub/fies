SYNOPSIS
========

``fies-dmthin`` [\ *OPTIONS*\ ] *VOLUMES*\ ...

DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a file extent stream from thin volumes. This can be used to archive or
convert thin volumes and snapshots created with lvm-thin or dmsetup. In order to
do this access to the thin pool's raw metadata device is required and a metadata
snapshot will be created. The thin volume should not be written to during this
operation. It is recommended to put it in read-only mode first.
The stream can later be extracted via the ``fies`` or ``fies-restore``
commands.

Volumes are processed in the order given. It is the caller's responsibility to
pass snapshots in the correct order (oldest to newest) since the device mapper
metadata does not really provide a defined way of obtaining dependency
information. Note that the order is only important if the intention is to
restore it via ``fies-restore``, whereas when unpacking the volumes as files
onto copy-on-write capable file systems such as btrfs the order does notmatter.
