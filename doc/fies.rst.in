SYNOPSIS
========

``fies`` {c|t|x}[v][f\ *FILENAME*\ ] [*ARGS*...]

``fies`` ``-c`` [\ ``-f`` *FIESTREAM*\ ] [\ *OPTIONS*\ ] [\ *FILE*\ ...]

``fies`` ``-x`` [\ ``-f`` *FIESTREAM*\ ] [\ *OPTIONS*\ ] [\ *PATTERN*\ ...]

``fies`` ``-t`` [\ ``-f`` *FIESTREAM*\ ] [\ *OPTIONS*\ ] [\ *PATTERN*\ ...]

DESCRIPTION
===========

fies is a command line tool to handle *fies* file extent streams, which are
comparable to streaming archives such as *tar*, with the key difference that
they refer to file extents rather than their content as raw data and can
represent various different types of extents as well as leave sections of the
files untouched for incremental updates. Extents can contain data, reference
a previous file to clone sections from it, allocate zero-filled space or
represent unallocated zero-filled sections.

``fies`` tries to restore extents the same way they are found in the
*fiestream* it is reading, which must be supported by the destination file
system. Since there are various restrictions on when cloning is possible, it
may be necessary to create literal copies of some sections. A common
requirement is block alignment. Whether or not ``fies`` should fall back to
copying the data if it cannot be cloned can be configured via the ``--clone``
option.

Since a *fiestream* takes shared data into account it is also possible to
represent volume data with copy-on-write snapshots, such as QCOW2 image files.
*fies* provides a generic way to restore the contents of a *fiestream* into
such a device via the ``fies-restore`` command.

OPTIONS
=======

.. \OPTIONS rst fies.options

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
===================
A regular expression starts with a delimiter, which can be one of ``/@|!,.:``,
which is used to separate the regular expression from the options following it.
In a search-and-replace regex there's additionally a replacement string before
the option section and an ``s`` before the delimiter which may be optional.

The pattern is a POSIX extended regular expression in which backslashes are
used to escape delimiter. Anything else will be passed to ``regcomp``\ (3) as
is. On the replacement side you can use ``\NUMBER`` to reference capture
groups. Group 0 and ``&`` refer to the entire match. Backslashes can be used
to escape both of these characters.

The following options can be appended:

* ``i`` to match case insensitively or ``I`` (the default) to match case
  sensitively
* ``n`` to disable capture groups or ``N`` (the default) to enable the. Note
  that you have to escape them on the replacement side regardless of this flag.
* ``m`` to enable multiline matching or ``M`` (the default) to disable it.

BUGS

Please report bugs to *FIXME*.
A known bug is the fact that this manpage currently contains a FIXME instead of
a link to where to report bugs.
