SYNOPSIS
========

``fies-rbd`` [\ *OPTIONS*\ ] [\ -- *CEPH\ OPTIONS*\ [--]] *VOLUME-SPEC*\ ...

DESCRIPTION
===========

Creates a file extent stream from RBD image and/or snapshot volumes. This allows
archiving or converting ceph RBD volumes including snapshots. The volumes should
not be written to during this operation. Snapshots can be specified explicitly
or included automatically depending on the options specified. Ceph options as
accepted by librbd can be used after an initial double dash parameter, these
should be equivalent to many of the parameters the ``rbd`` command line tool
accepts. Additionally an explicit ``--config`` parameter is accepted in the
initial options list.
The stream can later be extracted via the ``fies`` or ``fies-restore``
commands.

Volumes can be specified in the usual way: An optional pool, the image's name
followed by an optional snapshot. The first two seprated by a slash, the latter
two by an ``@`` symbol.

CONTENT ORDERING
================

Note that the order the images are specified on the command line will NOT be
honored. Instead, the images are sorted by pool and both implicitly and
explicitly added snapshots are sorted so that older snapshots come first and
their main image last.
