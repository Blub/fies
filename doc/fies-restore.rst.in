SYNOPSIS
========

``fies-restore`` [\ *OPTIONS*\ ] ``--snapshot=``\ *COMMAND* *FILE* [\ *NAME*\ ]

DESCRIPTION
===========

Extracts a fiestream onto a single file. Each file in the stream is assumed to
be one snapshot of the file and between each file a snapshot command is executed
to turn the current state into a snapshot. This allows restoring the state of a
device previously exported via ``fies-rbd``, ``fies-dmthin`` or ``fies-zvol``.

OPTIONS
=======

.. \OPTIONS rst fies-restore.options

COMMANDS
========

Commands are not interpreted by a shell currently. They're split. Single and
double quotes work similarly to how a shell handles them. Additionally the
following substitutions are made:

* ``%f`` ... The file name as passed to the command line.
* ``%n`` ... The device name as passed to the command line.
  or the same as ``%f`` if no name was specified, this is a convenience option.
* ``%s`` ... In the snapshot command: the snapshot's name.
* ``%z`` ... In the resize or create commands: the file size.

Note that substitutions happen after any parsing has happened and therefore are
never broken into multiple parameters by spaces or other special characters.

BUGS
====

Please report bugs to *FIXME*.
A known bug is the fact that this manpage currently contains a FIXME instead of
a link to where to report bugs.
