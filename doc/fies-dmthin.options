\opt -f FILE
\short use this file instead of stdin/stdout
    File to read from or write to. By default fies writes to stdout in create
    mode and reads from stdin in extract or list mode.

\opt -v, --verbose
\short be more verbose (can be used multiple times)
    Increase verbosity.

\opt --uid= UID
\short use this uid instead of the ones from the stream
    Created files will be owned by the specified user id. Can be ``-1`` to
    explicitly use the user ids from the stream.

\opt --gid= GID
\short use this gid instead of the ones from the stream
    Created files will be owned by the specified group id. Can be ``-1`` to
    explicitly use the group ids from the stream.

\opt -s, --xform= XFORM
\short apply file name transformations
    Transform file names via the supplied sed-like regular expression. See
    the `REGULAR EXPRESSIONS` section in `fies(1)`.

\opt --incremental
\short create an incremental stream
    Do not include the first volume's data. Instead, consider it to be a
    reference of data considered already available.

\opt --no-incremental
\short do not create an incremental stream
    This is the default. All volumes will be included normally.

\opt --snapshot-list= FILE
\short include a snapshot list from FILE
    The file must contain one snapshot definition per line. A snapshot
    definition starts with a timestamp in seconds since the epoch (with
    optional nanosecond precision), followed by its name up to the end of the
    line. The name is assumed to be encoded like filenames in to mtree(5) files
    (similar to mount points in `/proc/mounts`).

\opt --data-device= FILE
\short dmthin data device for raw access
    Path to the dmthin raw data device. This can be used when volumes cannot be
    activated via lvchange anymore.
    This option requires ``--metadata-device`` and ``--chunk-size`` to be set.

\opt --metadata-device= FILE
\short dmthin meta data device
    Path to the dmthin metadata device.
    Path to the dmthin raw data device. This can be used when volumes cannot be
    activated via lvchange anymore.
    This option requires ``--data-device`` and ``--chunk-size`` to be set.

\opt --chunk-size= BYTES
\short allocation chunk size
    Specifies the allocation chunk size used in the data device.
    This option is only used when ``--data-device`` and ``--metadata-device``
    are set.
